## Topic
The initial projects at 42 Heilbronn aim to provide a foundation in software development by teaching fundamental concepts and promoting a thorough understanding of commonly used standard functions. These projects serve as an introduction to key principles and set the stage for further learning and skill development.

## libft
`libft` is a libary with a bunch of of tools to work with strings and linked lists.

## printf
Own written `printf`. The `printf` function in C is used to format and print output to the console or another output stream. It takes a format string as input, which specifies the desired output format, and can include placeholders or format specifiers for various data types.

## get_next_line
`get_next_line` read and retrieve the next line from a file or input stream. It reads the input line by line, dynamically allocates memory for each line, and returns the line as a string. The function handles scenarios where the line may be longer than the buffer size and allows for sequential reading of a file until the end is reached.
